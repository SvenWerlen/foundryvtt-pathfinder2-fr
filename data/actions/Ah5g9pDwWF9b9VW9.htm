<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput"><strong>Requirements</strong> You aren’t fatigued or raging.</span></p>
<hr>
<p>You tap into your inner fury and begin raging. You gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your level plus your Constitution modifier. This frenzy lasts for 1 minute, until there are no enemies you can perceive, or until you fall unconscious, whichever comes first. You can’t voluntarily stop raging. While you are raging:</p>
<ul>
<li>You deal 2 additional damage with melee weapons and unarmed attacks. This additional damage is halved if your weapon or unarmed attack is agile.</li>
<li>You take a –1 penalty to AC.</li>
<li>You can’t use actions with the concentrate trait unless they also have the rage trait. You can Seek while raging.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;After you stop raging, you lose any remaining temporary Hit Points from Rage, and you can’t Rage again for 1 minute.&nbsp;</p>
