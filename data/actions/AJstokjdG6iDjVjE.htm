------ Description (en) ------
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">You create a disguise to pass yourself off as someone or something you are not. Assembling a convincing disguise takes 10 minutes and requires a <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=19">disguise kit</a>, but a simpler, quicker disguise might do the job if you’re not trying to imitate a specific individual, at the GM’s discretion.<br></span></p>
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">In most cases, creatures have a chance to detect your deception only if they use the <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=84">Seek</a> action to attempt Perception checks against your <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=5">Deception</a> DC. If you attempt to directly interact with someone while disguised, the GM rolls a secret Deception check for you against that creature’s Perception DC instead. If you’re disguised as a specific individual, the GM might give creatures you interact with a circumstance bonus based on how well they know the person you’re imitating, or the GM might roll a secret Deception check even if you aren’t directly interacting with others.</span></p>
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput"><strong>Success</strong> You trick the creature into thinking you’re the person you’re disguised as. You might have to attempt a new check if your behavior changes.<br><strong>Failure</strong> The creature can tell you’re not who you claim to be.<br><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature can tell you’re not who you claim to be, and it recognizes you if it would know you without a disguise.</span></p>
