<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput"><strong>Trigger</strong> An enemy damages, Grabs, or Grapples your ally, and both are within 15 feet of you.</span></p>
<hr>
<p>You free an ally from restraint. If the trigger was an ally taking damage, the ally gains resistance to all damage against the triggering damage equal to 2 + your level. The ally can attempt to break free of effects grabbing, restraining, immobilizing, or paralyzing them. They either attempt a new save against one such effect that allows a save, or attempt to Escape from one effect as a free action. If they can move, the ally can Step as a free action, even if they didn’t need to escape.&nbsp;</p>
