------ Description (en) ------
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">You hide a small object on your person (such as a weapon of light Bulk). When you try to sneak a concealed object past someone who might notice it, the GM rolls your Stealth check and compares it to this passive observer’s Perception DC. Once the GM rolls your check for a concealed object, that same result is used no matter how many passive observers you try to sneak it past. If a creature is specifically searching you for an item, it can attempt a Perception check against your Stealth DC (finding the object on success). <br></span></p>
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">You can also conceal an object somewhere other than your person, such as among undergrowth or in a secret compartment within a piece of furniture. In this case, characters Seeking in an area compare their Perception check results to your Stealth DC to determine whether they find the object. </span></p>
<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput"><strong>Success</strong> The object remains undetected.<br><strong>Failure</strong> The searcher finds the object.</span></p>
