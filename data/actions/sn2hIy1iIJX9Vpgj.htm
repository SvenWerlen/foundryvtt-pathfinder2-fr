<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput"><strong>Requirements</strong> A creature is undetected by one or more of your allies but isn’t undetected by you.</span></p>
<hr>
<p>You indicate a creature that you can see to one or more allies, gesturing in a direction and describing the distance verbally. That creature is <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=22">hidden</a> to your allies, rather than <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=39">undetected</a>. This works only for allies who can see you and are in a position where they could potentially detect the target. If your allies can’t hear or understand you, they must succeed at a Perception check against the creature’s Stealth DC or they misunderstand and believe the target is in a different location.&nbsp;</p>
