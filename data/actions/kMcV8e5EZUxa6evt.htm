<p><span id="ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput">You contort yourself to squeeze through a space so small you can barely fit through. This action is for exceptionally small spaces; many tight spaces are <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=453">difficult terrain</a> that you can move through more quickly and without a check. <br><br><strong>Critical Success</strong> You squeeze through the tight space in 1&nbsp;minute per 10 feet of squeezing.<br><strong>Success</strong> You squeeze through in 1 minute per 5 feet.<br><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You become stuck in the tight space. While you’re stuck, you can spend 1 minute attempting another Acrobatics check at the same DC. Any result on that check other than a critical failure causes you to become unstuck.</span></p>
