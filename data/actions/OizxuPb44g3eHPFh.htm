The GM sets the DC for the check based on the spell’s level and rarity; it’s typically a bit easier than Learning the Spell.<br><br><strong>Success</strong> You prepare the borrowed spell as part of your normal spell preparation.<br><strong>Failure</strong> You fail to prepare the spell, but the spell slot remains available for you to prepare a different spell. You can’t try to prepare this spell until the next time you prepare spells.&nbsp;</span></p>
